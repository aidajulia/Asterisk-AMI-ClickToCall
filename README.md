# Asterisk-AMI-ClickToCall - TwinBASIC/VB6
A lightweight Click-to-Call solution for Asterisk PBX, built with TwinBASIC/VB6.

This application enables web-based click-to-call functionality, allowing users to initiate phone calls directly from a web interface.

![Demo](screenshots/demo.jpg) <!-- Add a screenshot/GIF later -->

## Features
Web-based Click-to-Call integration with Asterisk PBX

Lightweight and minimalistic design

Compatible with TwinBASIC and legacy VB6 environments

Simple configuration for quick deployment

Basic status monitoring

## Prerequisites
**Asterisk PBX system** (FreePBX 16 with Asterisk 13/16/18) **OR** [Use our pre-configured demo environment, FreePBX16 Ast18](#demo-environment-setup):

**TwinBASIC compiler or VB6 IDE**

## Demo Environment Setup
**Quickstart for testing** üöÄ
*Do it yourself - DIY!*

1.  **Use our ready-to-deploy Proxmox virtualized Asterisk systems:**
    *Virtualize Your PBX with the PROXMOX Datacenter!*
    
    Download Proxmox Datacenter Backups:
    
    Demo1: [Primary VM - FreePBX16 Asterisk18](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vYheZXc9nzD32NDR6MrIh09tyoSy1Y9K?usp=sharing):

    Demo2: [Secondary VM - FreePBX16 Asterisk18](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N4D0CtDb_qLN8e0odDNO65q1-WD6hjfP/view?usp=sharing):


    *NOTE: Proxmox Backups for VM Deployment*
    
    These backups deploy VMs within the 10.10.11.0/24 network segment.

    For proper functionality of the interconnected Asterisk systems via trunk links, configure the IP addresses as follows:

    Primary VM (Demo1): Assign static IP 10.10.11.5

    (This VM will later host the Asterisk-AMI-ClickToCall demo)

    Secondary VM (Demo2): Assign static IP 10.10.11.13
   

    *Additional Configuration Details:*

    Each Asterisk PBX system has over 50 pre-configured extensions, 40 Trunk Channel.
    
    Demo1 includes a fully configured Call Center with all functionalities required to operate any of the planned demos.

    Interconnected Systems: You‚Äôll get two fully programmed Asterisk systems that are interconnected.
    

    *My Proxmox Setup Demo:*
    I‚Äôm running a Proxmox datacenter on an old ASUS laptop (2015 model: X551CA Celeron, 1.5 GHz, 4 GB RAM, 500 GB HDD).

    This setup    easily handles 1-2 VMs at a time.

    
2.  **Backups to Configure Your FreePBX16 + Asterisk18 Setup**
    If you set up your own Asterisk installation with FreePBX16 + Asterisk18, here is a backup file to restore the preconfigured settings required for the demo.
    
    *Download FreePBX16 Backups:*

3.  **Use our ready-to-deploy Asterisk PBX in a Raspberry Pi:**
    *Your PBX in a Raspberry Pi!*
    
    Download PiPOS PBX Backups:
    
    Demo1: [Primary PiPOS PBX Backups](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/???):


**Virtualizing Asterisk:** I recommend deploying Asterisk in a virtualized environment. For this, Proxmox is a solid and efficient solution.

Backup Links: Use the links above to download Asterisk backups for your own setup, or download the Proxmox backup to get a pre-configured Asterisk system (just like the one in our demo videos).



**To access Asterisk:**

Open a web browser.

Enter your Asterisk server‚Äôs IP address (or the VM IP where Asterisk is running).

login = admin, Password = admin.

SSH: root/PiPOSOverallroot
